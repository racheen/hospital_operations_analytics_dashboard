# Hospital Operations Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a data-driven analysis of **hospital operational performance**, focusing on patient flow, length of stay, staffing efficiency, and capacity utilization. The analysis is visualized through an interactive **Tableau dashboard** designed to support operational decision-making in healthcare settings.

The dataset is synthetic but modeled on realistic hospital scenarios, preserving patterns such as admission timing, age distribution, and billing variability.

## Scope of Work

This repository highlights **my individual contribution**, which focused exclusively on **hospital operations analytics**, including:

- Admission timing and volume analysis  
- Length-of-stay comparisons across hospitals and admission types  
- Doctor workload and utilization assessment  
- Hospital- and floor-level capacity utilization analysis  
- Translation of findings into operational recommendations  
- Tableau dashboard design and storytelling
